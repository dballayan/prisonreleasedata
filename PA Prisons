Reporter: Deesarine Ballayan

What Are We Trying To Do? :  Obtain release data from PA prisons throguh RTK that tells use the number of people with 
records in Philadelphia with a focus on the Germantown neighborhood. We want to know the amount of people that could be
helped by the Pardons Hub. Julie also wants to start collecting the data now because everywhere we turned didn't have 
solid informtation on the topic.

What Happened:  We received it ! But it makes no sense and needs some cleaning. I sent an email to Kim Grant,the person 
that sent the data, and asked if she had some sort of meta data or data dictionary to help me better understand the 
information. Julie says from the time they send the information you have 30 days after that to ask as many questions 
as you need about the data because to them they've already fufilled the RTK. 

What's Next: Data needs to be cleaned but before that we have to know what this stuff means. I have many questions 
for MS. Grant 
- What does location temporary mean ?
     * If you're on parole do you have to live somewhere specfic or can you go back to the county or city you 
lived in before you were imprisoned?
     * is it a county, city, beginning of an address? 
- What does permenant location mean? 
I also have questions for Julie
- How do you know the data is clean? 
We discusseed this vaguewly but Julie is making me a list of things to see if list is clean but see if there are any 
irregularities for example in the city collumn of the data sometimes it says PHILA or PHILADELPHIA we need to clean that
so that R recognizes these as the same.
